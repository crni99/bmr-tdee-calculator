    - BMR=66.47+(13.75×weight [kg])+(5.003×height [cm])−(6.755×age [years])
  - For Women:  
    - BMR=655.1+(9.563×weight [kg])+(1.85×height [cm])−(4.676×age [years])
- **TDEE Calculation**: Takes into account the user's activity level.
- **User-Friendly Design**: Responsive and easy to use with a modern user interface.
